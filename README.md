# FlyControll
An Android app to controll Parrot drones

## What is does
What it should do is to let you controll a Parrot drone bei tilting your phone or using the buttons of the app. To be honest it is just me playing around in Android Studio for a bit. It hooks up the accelerometer of your smartphone to determine the tilt and should work rudimentary. But make sure to have ample space when testing it with a drone.

## What you need
- a Parrot Drone
- a Android smartphone (no, i will not support iPhones)
- a working installation of AndroidStudio
- probably some lib i forgot to mention from parrot

This is just a project i did during one semester and i probably wont comeback working on it so feel free to modify to your liking
